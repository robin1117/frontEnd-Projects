          <h4>Some Common Definition of OS ?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>It is an interface between user and Hardware</li>
            <li>It is resources manager</li>
            <li>Set of utilities to simply application Development</li>
            <li>Control program Software</li>
            <li>Act like a Government</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Functions of Control Unit</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              It Generate Timing or Control Signals in the form of clock Pulses,
              with theses it controls all other units .
            </li>
            <li>It decides the Sequence execution of Micro-Operation</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Functions of ALU</h4>
          <p>
            Arithmetic Logic Unit or Functional Unit is Responsible for doing
            tasks like ADDITION , SUBSCTRACTION , MUL , DIVISION etc
          </p>
          <p>
            Together Control Unit and ALU we call it as a Processor / CPU /
            Micro Processor.
          </p>
          <h4>Primary Memory</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>it is also known Main/Physical Memory</li>
            <li>Examples -> RAM, ROM, Cache , Registers</li>
            <li>
              its Nature is Volatile -> As long as power supply available to
              memory we can perform Read/Write Operation on it , As soon the
              power supply went off content of the memory erased.
            </li>
            <li>Faster to access(n.s)*10^-9</li>
            <li>Small in Size</li>
            <li>Expensive</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Secondary Memory</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>it is also known as Auxiliary Memory</li>
            <li>Examples -> HDD, Pen-drives, DVD</li>
            <li>
              its Nature is Non Volatile -> As long as power supply available to
              memory we can perform Read/Write Operation on it , here content of
              the memory not gone be erased by itself Even when in no power .
            </li>
            <li>Slower to access(m.s)*10^-3</li>
            <li>Larger in size</li>
            <li>Not very Expensive</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            As per Von-Neuman Architecture , Secondary Storage Device are part
            of Input / Output Devices.

              ðŸ˜’1st Generation of Computers (1930-40) : there is no concept of
              OS
            </li>
            <li>
              ðŸ˜’2nd Generation of Computers (1940-50) : Magnetic tapes was
              Evolved but still there was no concept of OS
            </li>
            <li>
              3rd Generation of Computers (1950-60) : Magnetic disk( HDD, FLOPPY
              DISK ) were coming to giving rise to the two types of OS :
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>Uni-Programming-OS</li>
              <li>Multi-Programming-OS</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <h4>Uni-Programming-OS</h4>
          <p>
            A Uni-Programming Operating System is one where only a single
            program is loaded into memory and executed by the CPU at any given
            time. This approach was prevalent in early computing systems. Hereâ€™s
            a breakdown:
          </p>
          <h4>Multi-Programming-OS</h4>
          <p>
            Ability of the OS to hold (manage) multiple ready to run programs in
            memory.

          <p>
            kernel is main part of OS which is Core Part of OS which is
            responsible for managing important Hardware.
          </p>
          <p>
            User can not have privilege to interact with Hardware Directly. User
            must delegate to system call API interface to access Hardware,
            Memory and OS routines.
          </p>
          <p>
            - In Kernel mode , the executing code has complete and unrestricted
            access to the underlying hardware. it can execute any CPU
            instruction and reference any memory address. Kernel mode is
            generally reserved for the lowest-level, most trusted function of
            the OS . crashes in kernel mode are catastrophic , they will halt
            the entire PC

        <section id="On_Startup" class="main-section">
          <header>On Startup</header>
          <p>
            When you start a PC, the program that loads first into memory is the
            operating system. This is because the operating system is essential
            for managing all other programs on the computer and is initiated by
            a special program called a "boot loader".
          </p>
          <h4>Boot process:</h4>
          <p>
            When you turn on your computer, the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)
            searches for the boot loader program, which then loads the operating
            system into memory.
          </p>
          <h4>Boot loader:</h4>
          <p>
            This small program is responsible for initializing the hardware and
            starting the operating system.
