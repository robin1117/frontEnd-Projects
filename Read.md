# Frontend Practice Projects

Welcome to my collection of frontend development practice projects!  
This repository contains various small to mid-sized projects that I built while learning and improving my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Each folder represents a standalone project or concept.  
Most of them focus on layout techniques, responsive design, or component-based design using vanilla HTML/CSS.
