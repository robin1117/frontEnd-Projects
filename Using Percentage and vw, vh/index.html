    <h2>Testing vh and vw</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>vh</strong> stands for viewport height and <strong>vw</strong> for viewport width. As you can see,
      the first unit is based on the viewport height, and <strong>1vh is equivalent to
        1% of the viewport height </strong>. vw works the same, but for viewport width. So,
      <strong>1vw equals 1% of the viewport width.</strong>
