      <p>
        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
        readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of
        using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
        letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it
        look like readable English.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a programmer, you know that your work requires high focus, so it
        often takes up a lot of your time. Yes, this also happens to me, I spend
        a lot of time doing tasks but sometimes the results don't meet
        expectations. I realized several things that I had gained from my work
        experience and insights from my colleagues, and there was a book that
        was interesting and very helpful in improving my habits.
      </p>

      <p>
        Did you know that we live by following patterns and habits that we do
        every day, these habits will influence the results of our goals. So if
        you want to change your life and achieve what you want, the first thing
        you have to do is change your habits. Stephen R. Covey in his book
        <strong>7 Habits of Highly Effective People </strong>says that: ‚Äúthe way
        we see the world is entirely based on our own perceptions.‚Äù
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead of looking at the world that is so big for us, let's look at the
        smaller things first and relate to our daily activities. Yup, that's
        right, I want to share from my perspective as a programmer. There are
        several habits you should know to increase productivity when working as
        a programmer. Some of these things are also based on my experience, so
        the results may be different for you, but believe me, this will be
        useful if you practice it well. OK, let's get started!
      </p>

      <h2 id="first"> 1 Be Proactive <a href="#">üëÜ</a></h2>
      <p>
        In his book, Covey describes the two-circle types of people that exist
        in our lives. Circle of concern which is a circle containing things
        outside our control. Meanwhile, the smaller circle is the circle of
        influence, which contains things that we can control.
      </p>

      <img
        src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fp50j7r9vgw6hhipidjz2.png"
        alt=""
      />

      <p>
        Based on these two circles, reactive people will think more about the
        circle of concern while proactive people focus more on the circle of
        influence. It's the same with programmers, among us there are definitely
        two types of people.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are <strong>reactive programmers</strong> who are busy with things
        that cannot be controlled such as office conditions, and company
        finances, they even believe that their career can be determined by the
        video "How to Become the Best Programmer in Three Months". On the other
        hand, there are also <strong>proactive programmers</strong> who choose
        to practice, try several interviews and competitions, to open up
        opportunities to become a programmer or whatever their dream job.
      </p>

      <p>
        Proactive people know they need to know external things, but they are
        the ones who are responsible for their careers. In other words, to be
        proactive you can focus more on looking for inspiration from within
        yourself and you can control it without ignoring important things
        outside of yourself rather than just expecting other people to give you
        a "magic recipe".
      </p>

      <h2 id="Second"> 2 Begin With the End in Mind <a href="#">üëÜ</a></h2>
      <p>
        Many of us spend our lives going with the flow and we don't even know
        our purpose. So all we have is hope which is not a good strategy in any
        case. Stephen Covey says "Start with the end in mind" In other words, in
        doing anything, including starting a project, you must determine clear
        measures of success and a plan to achieve them.
      </p>
      <img
        src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fb1bbrkhtnd78rarqcfd8.png"
        alt=""
      />
      <p>
        If you apply this to programming, whenever you start a new project,
        you'll take the time to understand the final product. What are the
        functional and non-functional requirements of the features to be built?
      </p>
      <p>
        I remember someone saying software engineering is the art of making
        trade-offs. There are rarely right and wrong answers but rather a matter
        of determining the different types of design, and what the pros and cons
        are in a given case. Believe it or not, I have experienced that spending
        30 minutes on careful planning can save you more than 10 hours of
        programming.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        ‚ÄúPeople are working harder than ever, but because they lack clarity and
        vision, they aren‚Äôt getting very far. They, in essence, are pushing a
        rope with all of their might.‚Äù Dr. Stephen R. Covey
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Of course, this is not easy because every plan can go wrong, I also fell
        into it several times. But this is still much better than not planning
        anything at all.
      </p>
      <h2 id="Third"> 3 Put First Things First <a href="#">üëÜ</a></h2>
      <p>
        Having the ability to choose what is important and what is not is also
        an effective habit. By being able to sort your interests according to
        your needs, you will be able to prioritize the order of work that will
        be done first.
      </p>
      <p>
        This habit is closely related to time management. Covey advises us to do
        the main thing based on the four quadrants he created which he called
        the Eisenhower Matrix.
      </p>
      <img
        src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fhv4j1roh5p3f4gaw52uc.png"
        alt=""
      />

      <p>
        Previously I thought this quadrant was not that important for my tasks.
        And it turns out that this is often ignored by most programmers. When I
        worked as a Software Engineer, I was constantly bombarded by bugs that
        needed to be resolved. On the other hand, I also have long-term projects
        to complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you are under so much pressure, you will forget to learn. So if
        your code has a problem, you just want to go to Google or use AI and
        copy-paste the solution without really understanding it. Yes, truly
        understanding the cause of the problem is important for learning, but it
        is not urgent. For many programmers, learning stops as our careers
        progress. That's why you need to pay attention to the tasks that fall
        into this quadrant and schedule specific times for your long-term
        success. In other words, prioritize and achieve your most important
        goals rather than constantly reacting to urgency.
      </p>

      <h2 id="Fourth"> 4 Think Win-Win <a href="#">üëÜ</a></h2>
      <p>
        One person's gain is another person's loss - this idea is very familiar
        in our brains probably because of the various competitions and sporting
        events that we usually watch. In this book, Dr. Covey considers it
        important to develop an "abundance mentality". That is, believing that
        there are enough resources and opportunities for everyone to succeed.
        This mindset is crucial to having a successful career as a Software
        Engineer. We work alongside other engineers and people in other job
        functions such as Data Science and Product Management.
      </p>

      <img
        src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fw1thqzuw744a9usc2ezo.png"
        alt=""
      />

      <p>
        Being able to collaborate effectively is one of the main skills you need
        to have. So, it is very important to be able to rise above personal
        career goals and have a win-win mindset for the team. Not just winning
        yourself by making other people lose, or giving in to others so they
        win, or even making other people lose because we also lose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Getting used to always thinking about being able to win over many
        parties will make us always try to achieve the best results. More than
        that, this also greatly affects our relationships with other people in
        the long term.
      </p>
      <p>
        To build good relationships in the long term, we need to establish
        relationships with many people. Through think win-win this will help us
        build a good reputation or image in the future and will make our work
        more effective in the longer term.
      </p>
      <h2 id="Fifth"> 5 Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood <a href="#">üëÜ</a></h2>
      <p>
        Are you the type of person who is busy asking for your own feedback long
        before giving someone else a chance? This is not something Stephen Covey
        recommends
      </p>
      <img
        src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fbg3uigm6p7xm7h9stc7v.png"
        alt=""
      />
      <p>
        In order to be understood by other people, the first thing we need to do
        is understand other people first. Effective people will be able to have
        great empathy and respect other people by understanding them.
      </p>
      <p>
        But how does this apply to programmers? In addition to verbal
        communication, engineers also use their code to communicate with each
        other. Effective programmers understand the importance of empathy in
        coding. They prioritize clarity in their code to ensure that others,
        including themselves in the future, can understand and maintain it
        easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from other engineers, programmers also communicate with end users
        through their products. Effective programmers prioritize user experience
        by putting themselves in the end user's shoes. They anticipate user
        needs, design interfaces that deliver, and create error messages that
        guide users instead of confusing them.
      </p>
      <h2 id="Sixth"> 6 Synergize <a href="#">üëÜ</a></h2>
      <p>
        People who are able to synergize well with fellow humans will be
        effective people. Through good relationships and collaboration, you can
        create better solutions than if you only relied on yourself.
        Mathematically 1 + 1 = 2. But in life, if the synergy is right, it can
        be 1 + 1 = 10.
      </p>
      <img
        src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Flb8uq52jfzpkl28kyp32.png"
        alt=""
      />
      <p>
        In his book, Dr. Covey emphasizes the importance of appreciating
        differences and using them to create a whole that is greater than the
        sum of its parts. So it's about getting the most out of every team
        member to create a product that users love. Effective programmers adopt
        <strong>collaborative</strong> coding practices, such as code reviews,
        pair programming, and other knowledge sharing. By combining individual
        skills and insights, teams can build more powerful, efficient, and
        innovative products.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though it is not easy, especially for programmers, most of whom
        work individually, by getting used to this, we can not only become
        independent figures but can also become people who can work together and
        collaborate well with anyone.
      </p>
      <h2 id="Seventh"> 7 Sharpen the Saw <a href="#">üëÜ</a></h2>
      <p>
        Effective people will continue to practice things in their lives so that
        they continue to progress and develop well. Covey said there are four
        main things that we must hone in our lives; body, heart, mental, and
        spiritual. Yes, in general, this is very important for life in any
        field. But let's try to focus on something more specific.
      </p>
      <img
        src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Ff2tj8no1yezmseadugi4.png"
        alt=""
      />
      <p>
        For programmers, this is the most important habit. To understand this
        habit, let's imagine there are two workers trying to chop wood. The
        first worker was a young man who continued chopping wood for the entire
        8-hour shift without stopping. The second worker was an older man who
        needed a 10-minute break every hour, in between which he took time to
        sharpen his saw. If you think an older man will chop more wood, then you
        have understood this habit.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a programmer, you will be faced with so many new technologies.
        Effective programmers understand the importance of continuous learning.
        Sharpening the saw involves investing time in acquiring new skills,
        staying updated on industry trends, and exploring new technologies.
        Effective programmers must make time for professional development by
        practicing, attending conferences, participating in programming
        communities, and so on. This habit can help us adapt to technological
        advances.
