        <h2 id="sec-title">Here's a time line of Allen Turing:</h2>
        <p>
          Allen made significant contributions to the development of modern
          computing devices. Turing proposed the theoretical foundations of
          computation with his 1936 paper, "On Computable Numbers," which
          introduced the concept of the universal Turing machine. This machine
          model laid the basis for the design of modern computers. During World
          War II, Turing worked at the Government Code and Cypher School at
          Bletchley Park, where he played a crucial role in breaking German and
          Italian codes, significantly impacting the war effort. His work on the
          theoretical limits of computation, particularly the halting problem,
          and his development of the Turing test for measuring machine
          intelligence, have had a lasting impact on the field of computer
          science.
